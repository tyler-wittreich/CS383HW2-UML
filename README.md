# CS383HW2-UML
The Team A Repo for HW2

UPDATE
--------------

Hey guys!

So I've been seeing a lot of good work on the repo! I've also caught the messages where people are having issues getting Git up and running on their computers/adding files. I propose a change to our original planned schedule.

Right after class, let's meet up and head over to a room in ThinkTank or the CSAC!

!. Git Issues:

Today during our meeting, we can get Git up and running for everyone. Git can be tricky, especially if you don't have the GUI for windows or a VM for via command line. There were some great tutorial links posted in the comments, and I think it would be beneficial to make sure everyone's on board for class.

2. Voting:

Since a lot of people aren't done with their UML diagrams, I put a document up on Github that will let us vote on which one we like best. I propose that by Saturday night we have our UML diagrams/descriptions up and by Sunday morning we vote. 

Sunday morning I will packaged the diagram we like the most and send it over to Dr J. 

3. Descriptions:

Keep in mind that use case diagrams should also have an accompanying description set. When you post your UML diagram, post a quick .txt file with your descriptions! 

Cheers!
