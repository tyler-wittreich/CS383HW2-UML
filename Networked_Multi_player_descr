    \section{Networked Multi-Player }
    Our concept for multi-player is implemented through separate instances. 
    These instances would occur when a player enters a dungeon with other players,
    or wishes to trade with other players. This would feel similar to World of
    Warcraft dungeoning because you can wait for people you do not know to be 
    gathered into a group, or you can get a group of friends together to do a 
    dungeon. Players can do multi-player trading inside dungeons where they 
    are already multi-player instanced, or they can create a multi-player 
    instance specifically for trading. This could look like a ``break room'' 
    where you can go to trade with anyone, or just with a list of approved players.
