    \section{Use Case: Multi-player}
	Players are linked together from different machines to play the game in a co-operative environment.

		\subsection{Actor(s)}
		
			Player 1 and Player 2

		\subsection{Precondition}
 
			A second user must exist before multi-player tasks and strategies can be implemented.
	
		\subsection{Description}
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item A player attempts to enter a dungeon.
			\item If they choose to play multi-player, the player is placed into a queue to await a playing partner.
			\item Both players are linked by the system, entering the dungeon in a co-operative environment. Both players are able to perform the same functions as if they were in single player, such as shopping, item use, character advancement, and environment interaction.
			\end{enumerate}

		\subsection{Postcondition}
		
			Multi-player ends when a player disconnects, or both players have agreed to exit the dungeon. It is also possible for a player to die within a dungeon during multi-player. At this time, the gameplay would revert back to a single player environment until the downed player could be revived.
